# Testing & CI

* All CLI logic is covered by **Vitest** unit tests under `tests/cli/`.
* Template‑generation is validated by snapshot tests (`tests/templates/`).
* CI (GitHub Actions) runs `npm run test` and checks formatting.
* Before publishing a new version, run `npm run test -- --update` to refresh snapshots if necessary.
