# Project Overview & Guidelines

This repository contains **agent‑rules‑kit**, a CLI tool and template set that bootstraps Cursor rules for multiple stacks.
The rules in this folder *govern the maintenance of this very project*.

| Topic | Quick rule |
|-------|------------|
| CLI changes | Update code in `cli/services/` modules and `cli/index.js`; add unit and integration tests. |
| Templates | Follow folder layout: `templates/global/`, `templates/stacks/<stack>/base/`, `templates/stacks/<stack>/architectures/`, `templates/stacks/<stack>/v*/`. |
| Config | Keep `templates/kit-config.json` as single source of truth for globs, version ranges & default architectures. |
| Releases | Bump `package.json` + CHANGELOG. Tag using `vx.y.z`. |
| Language | **All code, documentation, and files must be written in English**, even if communicating with the agent in another language. |

## Language Policy

While you may interact with the agent in any language, all project files, code, comments, documentation, and rules must be written in English. This ensures consistency and maintainability across the project. When working with the Agent Rules Kit:

- Write all code, comments, and docstrings in English
- Create documentation files in English
- Use English for variable names, function names, and other identifiers
- Use English for commit messages and pull requests
- Keep configuration files in English

For example, if you're communicating with the agent in Spanish, the agent should respond in Spanish, but any generated or modified code must still be in English.
