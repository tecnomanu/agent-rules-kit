# State Management Implementation v1.0.0

## React State Management Libraries Added

We've implemented comprehensive guides for two major state management libraries in React:

### 1. Redux Implementation

Added detailed documentation for implementing Redux in React applications:

-   **Store Setup**: Proper configuration with Redux Toolkit
-   **Feature Organization**: Modern slice-based approach
-   **Async Operations**: Thunk implementation for API calls
-   **RTK Query**: Advanced data fetching and caching
-   **Best Practices**: Guidelines for structuring Redux code
-   **Performance Considerations**: Selector patterns and normalization

The implementation follows the recommended Redux Toolkit approach with:

-   Action creators and reducers defined together via createSlice
-   Normalized state structure and proper selectors
-   Typed hooks for TypeScript integration
-   Component examples showing real-world usage

### 2. MobX Implementation

Added complete documentation for implementing MobX in React applications:

-   **Store Structure**: Class-based observable stores
-   **Action Patterns**: Proper mutation patterns and async flows
-   **Computed Properties**: Derivation of state
-   **Reactions**: Side-effect management
-   **Context Integration**: React context setup for store injection
-   **Performance Patterns**: Component optimization strategies

The MobX implementation showcases:

-   Object-oriented approach to state management
-   Local vs. global state patterns
-   Cross-store communication patterns
-   Form state management
-   Comparison with Redux to help developers choose the right tool

## Directory Organization

-   Created proper directory structure under `templates/stacks/react/state-management/`
-   Organized implementations in dedicated folders:
    -   `redux/` - Redux implementation files
    -   `mobx/` - MobX implementation files

## Next Steps

Continue implementing additional state management libraries:

1. Recoil - Facebook's experimental state management library
2. Zustand - Lightweight state management with hooks

Each implementation will follow the same comprehensive pattern established with Redux and MobX, providing clear guidance on:

-   Directory structure
-   Store setup
-   Component integration
-   Best practices
-   When to use the particular library
