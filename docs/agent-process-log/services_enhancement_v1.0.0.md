# Services Enhancement v1.0.0

## Angular Service Implementation

We've implemented a new Angular-specific service with the following features:

1. **Angular Service Creation**: Added `angular-service.js` with support for:

    - Architecture-specific rule copying
    - Version-specific rule overlays
    - Signals implementation for Angular 16+
    - Testing rules support

2. **CLI Integration**:
    - Added Angular to the list of supported stacks in the CLI
    - Implemented Angular-specific questions for:
        - Architecture selection
        - Signals integration
        - Version detection and selection
    - Integrated the service with the main CLI flow

## React Architecture Implementation

Added support for two important architecture patterns in React:

1. **Atomic Design**:

    - Created documentation and implementation guidelines
    - Added comprehensive examples for all atomic levels (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
    - Implemented best practices section
    - Added guidance on when to use Atomic Design

2. **Feature Sliced Design**:
    - Created detailed documentation for this architecture pattern
    - Added comprehensive examples for all layers (shared, entities, features, widgets, pages)
    - Implemented directory structure guides
    - Added best practices for layer dependencies, feature isolation, and public API design

## Code Organization

-   Created proper directory structure for new architectures
-   Ensured all new code follows the project's coding standards
-   Added appropriate error handling and debug logging
-   Updated the main CLI logic to support new architectures and services

## Testing

-   Ran existing tests to ensure backward compatibility
-   All tests pass without any issues

## Next Steps

1. Implement state management templates:

    - Redux
    - MobX
    - Recoil
    - Zustand

2. Add testing guidelines for:

    - Svelte
    - SvelteKit

3. Add E2E testing documentation for all frameworks
