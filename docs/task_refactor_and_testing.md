# Refactor and Testing Tasks

## 1. Code Organization

The code has been reorganized into independent modules for better maintainability and readability:

-   `/cli/utils/file-helpers.js`: File manipulation functions
-   `/cli/utils/stack-helpers.js`: Common stack handling functions
-   `/cli/utils/nextjs-helpers.js`: Next.js specific functions
-   `/cli/utils/config.js`: Project configuration and constants
-   `/cli/index.js`: Main entry point, refactored to use the above modules

## 2. Functionality Improvements

Specific improvements have been implemented:

-   **Template variable substitution**: The `version-info.md` file now correctly replaces values for `{projectPath}`, `{detectedVersion}`, and `{versionRange}` in templates.

-   **Architecture reorganization**: Architectures have been moved within each stack in the `kit-config.json` file for better organization, following the structure:

    ```
    laravel: {
        architectures: {
            standard: { ... },
            ddd: { ... },
            hexagonal: { ... }
        }
    }
    ```

-   **Version selection**: Version detection has been improved to allow users to confirm the detected version or select one manually.

-   **Localization**: All texts have been updated to English for better international user experience.

## 3. Unit Testing Implementation

Unit tests have been created for all modules:

-   `tests/cli/file-helpers.test.js`: Tests for file manipulation functions
-   `tests/cli/stack-helpers.test.js`: Tests for stack handling functions
-   `tests/cli/nextjs-helpers.test.js`: Tests for Next.js specific functions
-   `tests/cli/config.test.js`: Tests for configuration and constants

Vitest is used as the testing framework with mocks for external dependencies.

## 4. Documentation and Resources

-   Project logo has been added for use in documentation and repository
-   README has been updated with additional information about CLI usage
-   Comprehensive unit tests have been added to verify functionality
-   All documentation has been translated to English
