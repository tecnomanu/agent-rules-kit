## Pending Tasks

### Architectural Refactoring

-   [x] Create a service structure instead of helpers:

    -   [x] Create `services/base-service.js` with shared functions like `debugLog` and `copyFiles`
    -   [x] Create stack-specific services: `laravel-service.js`, `nextjs-service.js`, `react-service.js`
    -   [x] Move stack-specific constants from `config.js` to each service
    -   [x] Refactor `index.js` to make it cleaner by delegating to services

-   [x] Remove redundancies between architecture helpers:

    -   [x] Refactor `copyArchitectureRules` to be a generic function
    -   [x] Use composition strategy where each service provides its specific behavior

-   [x] Reorganize CLI functionalities:
    -   [x] Create `cli-service.js` to handle command line interface
    -   [x] Clearly separate UI/UX logic from processing logic
    -   [x] Standardize messages and emojis in one place

### Pending UI/UX Improvements

-   [x] Alert if the rules-kit folder already exists or if the selected stack folder also exists
-   [x] If the folder exists, generate a backup with today's date and copy the current ones
-   [x] Clarify relative path message: "Relative path to your project (if not in the root)" by adding "from .cursor directory"
-   [x] Move logs to debug mode, not removing them but disabling them in normal mode
-   [x] Add more colors and emojis to the CLI

### New Implementations

-   [x] Create React-specific helpers for architectures and state management
-   [x] Create Angular-specific helpers
-   [x] Implement atomic architecture for React
