# Framework Version Information

This project is using **{stack}** version **{detectedVersion}**.

## Version-Specific Considerations

The rules in this folder are adapted for {stack} {detectedVersion}, which falls into the "{versionRange}" compatibility range.

## Project Structure

The application is located at: `{projectPath}`

## Detected Components

The system has detected your {stack} installation and will apply appropriate rules for:

-   Core framework functionality
-   Configuration files
-   Testing patterns
-   Best practices
-   Architecture guidelines

## Architecture

These rules are configured for your chosen architecture style. You can find specific architecture guidelines in the related architecture rules.

## Template Variables

This file demonstrates the use of template variables:

-   `{stack}` - The detected framework name
-   `{detectedVersion}` - The detected version number
-   `{versionRange}` - The compatible version range
-   `{projectPath}` - The path to the project root

These variables are automatically replaced when the rules are generated.
